It seems fitting to start with a childhood story for my first blog post. As a kid, I was obsessed with stop-motion animation. I don't remember how exactly my obsession startedâ€”actually, scratch that, it's coming back to me now. It all started with this Youtuber, [Michael Hickox](https://www.youtube.com/@MlCHAELHlCKOXFilms/). After watching his videos for the first time as a kid, I was blown away by the way he made stories come to life with Lego. I desperately wanted to make my own animations.

In 2014, when I was ~9 years old, my mom sent me to a summer camp for stop-motion, where I produced my first full-fledged animated film. It's still on Youtube, if you want to give it a [watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zU8lnTD6jIY) (warning: I had a couple screws loose as a kid).

Anyways, what's the point of this blog post? I'm going to live my animation dreams, after all, right? What do I even mean by that? In short, I want to relive those pure moments of creative discovery and exploration that I had as a kid. It was easy back then; children are blessed with the gift of unlimited novelty in anything they do. In order to get at that experience, I've downloaded an app for 2D animation to see how much creative energy I can release.

I'm going to play around with it see what I can cook up.

Fast forward...

Not too shabby for a first time, but there's plenty of room for improvement. This was a pretty fun little project, and I'll post updates if I decide to make more short animations.
