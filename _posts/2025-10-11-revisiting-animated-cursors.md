About a year and a half ago, I became a little bit obsessed with animated cursors.

I first found out about RealWorld Cursor Editor and the massive online sphere of cursor making ([check it out!](https://www.rw-designer.com/gallery?search=moving+cursors&by=dls)) after seeing a classmate using an animated cursor. The sheer amount of creative potential being unleashed within that tiny 32x32 pixel canvas was truly something to behold. As I was browsing, I saw a Terraria slime themed cursor pack, and I instantly knew what I needed to make: Terraria critter cursors. Terraria was a huge part of my childhood, and memories of playing it as a kid have given the game a special place in my heart. Terraria's pixel-art nature made it an especially good candidate for cursor creationâ€”the small critters would fit really nicely as cursor pets. What made it even better was that I had access to the game's sprite animations, so all I needed to do was copy them into the cursor editor.

Here are some of my favorites:

The process was pretty tedious, involving a lot of cutting up animation frames and pasting them into the editor. I figured that if I was just going to be copying and pasting frames, I could definitely automate the process, but that deserves its own blog post. This post is more of a showcase of some stuff I found pretty cool. Hope you did, too.
